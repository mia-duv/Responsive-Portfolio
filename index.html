        <p class="bio">Hello World! I am Mia, a Systems Analyst for NYCHHC. Helping all of New York City major hospitals and their clinics with any application issues. I started my career in IT in 2011. I acquired the A+, Network+, and MCTS industry certifications. I have worked in the telecommunications industry with my work at Altice (previously Cablevision). I worked with both residential and business accounts troubleshooting internet and VoIP connection issues. When needed I assisted with escalated issues and worked with other teams to resolve an issue for a client. 
        Also worked in the media industry with NBC Sports. I worked closely with Software Engineers when customers faced issues with the NBC sports and NBC Gold products. This led me to switch my focus on learning programming. </p>
